# Book-Management-System
A Visual Basic (.Net) program coded by me that calculates the customer bill when taking orders for the books. Special discounts are being offered to the following:  路 Students at the College (15%)  路 Faculty (20%)  路 College Staff Members (10%)  路 Other New Jersey College Students (10%)  In addition, this system adds 6% of NJ tax in the calculations, except for Faculty members, who pay no tax on class books.
It also contains a login form page, which allows users to go in the main management system, only if the login credentials are right. The username and the password have been successfully uploaded
